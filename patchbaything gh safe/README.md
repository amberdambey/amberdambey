does not work in safari/webkit. does semi-work in chromium (aka google spyware) tested on ungoogled-chromium 109 on arch linux. works perfectly with flawless performance in firefox/mozilla (e.g. librewolf, icecat, ...) tested on firefox esr 115 on windows 8.1 and librewolf 133 on arch linux. untested on older versions of chromium, but isnt likely to work because of its usage of "let", "const", "class", js modules, etc
