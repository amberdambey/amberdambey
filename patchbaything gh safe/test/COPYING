 Files in this directory may be subject to copyright and are not intended to be 
  publicly shared. The purpose of these files is to serve as placeholders for   
other resources which may eventually take their place, or to serve as arbitrary 
      examples during testing. Some of the files in this directory and its      
  subdirectories are considered to exist in the public domain in at least the   
 United States, but there is no guarantee this is the case for other countries.
